<p><ul><li>"Marketplace Bidding"</li><li>"Direct Bidding"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Online bidding markets can be categorized into two main types: Marketplace Bidding and Direct Bidding. Marketplace Bidding involves platforms where multiple sellers list their products or services, allowing buyers to bid against each other, fostering competition and potentially driving prices up.

This method can lead to negotiations directly between the buyer and seller, creating tailored deals without intermediary influence.</p></p>
