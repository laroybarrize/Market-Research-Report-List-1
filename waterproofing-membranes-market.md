<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Waterproofing Membranes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sheet Based Membranes</li><li>Liquid Applied Membranes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The waterproofing membranes market comprises two primary types: sheet-based membranes and liquid-applied membranes. Sheet-based membranes are pre-manufactured materials, usually made from asphalt, PVC, or TPO, that are installed in large rolls to create a continuous barrier against water. In contrast, liquid-applied membranes are applied as liquid coatings that cure to form a seamless, flexible, and durable layer. Both types are essential in protecting structures from water infiltration, but they offer different installation techniques and performance characteristics suited to various applications.</p></p>
