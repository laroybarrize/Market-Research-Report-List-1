<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alzheimer's Disease Treatments Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cholinesterase Inhibitors</li><li>NMDA Antagonists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Alzheimer's Disease treatments market includes two main types: cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA antagonists. Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil and rivastigmine, work by increasing levels of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in memory and learning, providing symptomatic relief in mild to moderate cases. NMDA antagonists, like memantine, address glutamate activity to help regulate nerve signal transmission and protect against excitotoxicity, typically used for moderate to severe stages. Together, these treatments aim to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life for patients.</p></p>
